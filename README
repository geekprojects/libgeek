libgeek - The GeekProjects.com utlity suite
===========================================

What?
-----------

This suite contains lots of useful bits of code that I often end up recreating
or copying between my projects.

I've divided the code up in to separate libraries (Hence the word suite) to
make it easier to just just the bits I'm after:

* core - Useful for all sorts of projects
* gfx  - Useful for graphics and drawing
* gtk  - Useful gtkmm widgets etc

Why?
----

I've largely been maintaining these for my own benefit. I know the same
functionality will be available in other libraries but I've learnt a lot by
doing it myself and they also more closely match the way I do things, rather
than having to match someone else's style.

But I hope they will also be of use to someone else!


Where?
------

I've been developing this library on both Mac OS X (10.11) and Linux.


Who?
----
